# Laboratory 2

The purposes of this assignment are:
 1. to compare carbohydrate and fat as fuels for oxidative phosphorylation (aerobic ATP resynthesis) during exercise
 2. to quantify the relative and absolute contributions of carbohydrate and fat at 35, 65, and 80% of estimated VO2max, and the percentage of VO2max at which the crossover point occurs
 3. to estimate the amount of carbohydrate that would need to be available to perform exercise or specified durations and intensities
