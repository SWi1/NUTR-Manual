# Laboratory 4

The purpose of this laboratory is to:
 1. Create your own ORS and understand how solution components contribute to overall solution osmolarity
 2. Assess how ORS compares to water in affecting change in blood osmolality from a dehydrated state with and without physical activity
 3. Assess how ORS compares to water in affecting change in body fluids from a dehydrated state with and without physical activity
