# Laboratory 4

The purpose of this laboratory is to:
   1. Assess daily fluid intake.
   2. Compare body mass, intracellular and extracellular water volumes, and urine osmolality between euhydrated (optimal hydration) and hypohydrated (some amount of dehydration) conditions.
   3. Create your own ORS and understand how solution components contribute to overall solution osmolarity.
   4. Assess the hemodilution effects of water versus your ORS in the hypohydrated state.
